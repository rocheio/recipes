## Tools

- Everything requires a set of measuring cups / spoons
- Every other required tool or appliance should be noted
- Every time a knife is required, assume a cutting board is required too
- When using a baking sheet, you should also use one of:
    - Silicone baking mat
    - Parchment paper
    - Wax paper
- Mixing spoons can be substituted with an electric hand mixer or stand mixer
    - This will reduce the estimated prep time by 5-10 minutes

## Ingredients

- Should be listed in order of mass
- Cooking spray or butter to prevent sticking may be omitted
- Lemon juice may be substituted 1:1 with white vinegar

    - This will give a dish more umami and a more complex flavor
- Chipotle chili powder may be substituted 1:3 with regular chili powder
    - This will give a dish a spicier and more smoky flavor

### Garlic

- Should be listed in teaspoons
- One medium-size clove is about equal to 1.5 teaspoons
