- **Prep Time:** 30 minutes
- **Prove Time:** 2-3 hours
- **Cook Time:** 40 minutes
- **Cool Time:** 10 minutes

## Tools

- clean work surface for kneading dough
- oven
- large mixing bowl
- 9x13 inch baking tray
- rolling pin
- plastic wrap
- parchment paper

## Ingredients

- 2 cups strong white bread flour (plus extra for dusting)
- 15 ounce can of diced fire-roasted tomatoes
- 7 ounces pesto (one small jar)
- 5 ounces mozzarella (pre-grated, drier is better)
- 3 ounces parmesan (pre-grated, drier is better)
- 0.25 ounces fast-action dried yeast (1 small packet)
- 2 tablespoons olive oil (plus extra for drizzling)
- 1 tablespoon basil
- 1.5 teaspoons fine salt
- 1 teaspoon golden caster sugar

## Method

- Combine in a large mixing bowl:
	- flour
	- yeast
	- sugar
	- salt
- Dust a clean work surface with flour for kneading the dough
- Add to the large mixing bowl:
	- 1 cup warm water
	- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- Mix ingredients together in bowl until they form a dough
	- Add dashes of water as needed if dough seems too dry
- Knead for 10 minutes by hand on the work surface
	- The dough is ready when it feels soft, springy and elastic
- Clean the large mixing bowl
- Drizzle a little olive oil into the bowl
	- Coat the entire inside of the bowl with the oil
- Place the dough into the bowl
- After a few seconds, flip the dough over
	- Ensure the dough and bowl are covered in a thin layer of oil
- Cover the bowl with some oiled cling film
- Set aside in a warm place to prove for 1-2 hours
	- The proving is complete when the dough has doubled in size
- Drain the fire-roasted tomatoes
	- Set on cutting board and pat with paper towels until mostly dry
- Line a baking tray with parchment paper
- Clean and flour your work surface
- Uncover the dough and confirm it has proved
- Punch the dough down into the bowl with your fist
	- Do this a couple times to knock out all the air bubbles
- Tip the dough out onto the floured work surface
- If the dough is sticky, dust the top with a little flour
- Roll the dough into a rectangle, roughly 16 x 12 inches
- Scatter evenly over the dough:
	- pesto
	- tomatoes
	- mozzarella cheese
	- parmesan cheese
	- basil
- Roll the dough up from a long side, for a longer, skinnier roll
	- The roll should be tight enough to retain a spiral shape when cut
- Use a sharp knife to cut the dough into 12 even pieces
- Arrange rolls on the baking tray, cut-side up, in a 3-by-4 formation
	- Make sure the open end of each roll is tucked in towards the center
		- This will prevent them from uncoiling during cooking
	- Leave a finger width of space between each roll
		- They will grow and touch as they prove
- Cover the tray with oiled cling film
- Set aside in a warm place to prove for 30 minutes to 1 hour
	- The proving is complete when the dough has doubled in size again
- Preheat oven to 350F
- Uncover the bread once it has puffed up fully
- Bake on the middle shelf in the oven for 35-40 minutes
	- The top should be golden brown and the centers should be dry and not doughy
- Remove from the oven
- Leave to cool in tray for at least 10 minutes
